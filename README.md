### **Features**

❤️ **Lightweight:** Crafted with minimalistic UI design.

⚡️ **Fast:** Send requests and get responses in real time.

🗄️ **HTTP Methods:** Request methods define the type of action you are requesting to be performed.

- `GET` - Requests retrieve resource information
- `POST` - The server creates a new entry in a database
- `PUT` - Updates an existing resource
- `PATCH` - Very similar to `PUT` but makes a partial update on a resource
- `DELETE` - Deletes resource or related component
- `HEAD` - Retrieve response headers identical to those of a GET request, but without the response body.
- `CONNECT` - Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource
- `OPTIONS` - Describe the communication options for the target resource
- `TRACE` - Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource
- `<custom>` - Some APIs use custom request methods such as `LIST`. Type in your custom methods.

🌈 **Theming:** Customizable combinations for background, foreground, and accent colors.

- Choose a theme: System preference, Light, Dark, and Black
- Choose accent colors: Green, Teal, Blue, Indigo, Purple, Yellow, Orange, Red, and Pink
- Distraction-free Zen mode

🚀 **Request:** Retrieve response from endpoint instantly.

1. Choose `method`
2. Enter `URL`
3. Send

- Copy/share public "Share URL"
- Generate/copy request code snippets for 10+ languages and frameworks
- Import `cURL`
- Label requests

🔌 **WebSocket:** Establish full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

📡 **Server-Sent Events:** Receive a stream of updates from a server over an HTTP connection without resorting to polling.

🌩 **Socket.IO:** Send and Receive data with the SocketIO server.

🦟 **MQTT:** Subscribe and Publish to topics of an MQTT Broker.

🔮 **GraphQL:** GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.

- Set endpoint and get schema
- Multi-column docs
- Set custom request headers
- Query schema
- Get query response

🔐 **Authorization:** Allows to identify the end-user.

- None
- Basic
- Bearer Token
- OAuth 2.0
- OIDC Access Token/PKCE

📢 **Headers:** Describes the format the body of your request is being sent in.

- FormData, JSON, and many more
- Toggle between key-value and RAW input parameter list

📮 **Response:** Contains the status line, headers, and the message/response body.

- Copy the response to the clipboard
- Download the response as a file
- View response headers
- View raw and preview HTML, image, JSON, and XML responses

⏰ **History:** Request entries are synced with your cloud/local session storage.

📁 **Collections:** Keep your API requests organized with collections and folders. Reuse them with a single click.

- Unlimited collections, folders, and requests
- Nested folders
- Export and import as a file or GitHub gist

_Collections are synced with your cloud/local session storage._

📜 **Pre-Request Scripts:** Snippets of code associated with a request that is executed before the request is sent.

- Set environment variables
- Include timestamp in the request headers
- Send a random alphanumeric string in the URL parameters
- Any JavaScript functions

👥 **Workspaces:** Organize your personal and team collections environments into workspaces. Easily switch between workspaces to manage multiple projects.
