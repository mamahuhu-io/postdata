### **Features**

‚ù§Ô∏è **Lightweight:** Crafted with minimalistic UI design.

‚ö°Ô∏è **Fast:** Send requests and get responses in real time.

üóÑÔ∏è **HTTP Methods:** Request methods define the type of action you are requesting to be performed.

- `GET` - Requests retrieve resource information
- `POST` - The server creates a new entry in a database
- `PUT` - Updates an existing resource
- `PATCH` - Very similar to `PUT` but makes a partial update on a resource
- `DELETE` - Deletes resource or related component
- `HEAD` - Retrieve response headers identical to those of a GET request, but without the response body.
- `CONNECT` - Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource
- `OPTIONS` - Describe the communication options for the target resource
- `TRACE` - Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource
- `<custom>` - Some APIs use custom request methods such as `LIST`. Type in your custom methods.

üåà **Theming:** Customizable combinations for background, foreground, and accent colors.

- Choose a theme: System preference, Light, Dark, and Black

- Import `cURL`
- Label requests

üì° **Server-Sent Events:** Receive a stream of updates from a server over an HTTP connection without resorting to polling.

üå© **Socket.IO:** Send and Receive data with the SocketIO server.

ü¶ü **MQTT:** Subscribe and Publish to topics of an MQTT Broker.

üîÆ **GraphQL:** GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.

- Set endpoint and get schema
- Multi-column docs
- Set custom request headers
- Query schema
- Get query response

üîê **Authorization:** Allows to identify the end-user.

- Set environment variables
- Include timestamp in the request headers
- Send a random alphanumeric string in the URL parameters
- Any JavaScript functions
